This repository contains the material from a short lecture I gave on using tables and figures in LaTeX, during the TeleLaTeX course organised by the Bari and Palermo Local AISF Committees in December 2023.

## Contents
- `lecture3_tabs_and_figs` contains the main TeX file and figures used during the lecture
- `samples` folder contains dummy text and data
- `TeleLaTeX_2020-21.pdf` is the collaborative guide written by G. Cusimano, E. Di Benedetto and myself during the 2021 edition of TeleLaTeX (in Italian)
- `telelatex_lect3_dec2023.pdf` contains the lecture slides

Besides some sample text and data used as demonstrations during the lecture, I included the collaborative "TeleLaTeX" guide written in 2021 and the lecture slides (both in Italian), plus a `dark_side` TeX file which reproduces a very familiar image.
