This repository contains the material from a short lecture I gave on using tables and figures in LaTeX, during the TeleLaTeX course organised by the Bari and Palermo Local AISF Committees in December 2023.

## Contents
- `ex3_tabs_and_figs` contains the main TeX file and figures used during the lecture
- `samples` contains dummy text and data
- `lectures` contains the lecture slides and the collaborative guide written by G. Cusimano, E. Di Benedetto and myself during the 2021 edition of TeleLaTeX (in Italian)
- `dark_side` contains a TeX file which recreates a very familiar image :)
