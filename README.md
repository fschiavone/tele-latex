# tele-latex

This repository contains the material from a short lecture I gave on using tables and figures in LaTeX, during the TeleLaTeX course organised by the Bari and Palermo Local AISF Committees in December 2023.

Besides some sample text and data used as demonstrations during the lecture, I included the collaborative "TeleLaTeX" guide written in 2021, the lecture slides (both in Italian) and a `dark_side` LaTeX file which reproduces a very familiar image.
